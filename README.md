# Josh's Calculus Notes

This is a curated set of Calculus notes designed to be both **comprehensive** and **digestible**. The content follows the structure of a rigorous calculus curriculum—from functions through vector calculus—covering the full scope of Calculus I, II, and III.

Each topic includes:

- **Key Ideas** – Core concepts to internalize  
- **Definitions** – Formal and precise statements  
- **Concepts** – Clear, instructive explanations  
- **Example Problems** – Fully worked-out solutions  
- **Practice Problems** – For self-assessment  
- **Josh’s Tip** – Strategic advice to build intuition
