# Josh's Calculus Notes

This is a curated set of Calculus notes designed to be both comprehensive and digestible. These notes follow the flow of a rigorous calculus curriculum from functions through vector calculus, encompassing all of Calculus 1, 2, and 3.

Each topic includes:

- **Key Ideas**: What you need to internalize
- **Definitions**: Formal precision
- **Concepts**: Clear, instructive explanations
- **Example Problems**: With full solutions
- **Practice Problems**: For self-assessment
- **Tutor’s Tip**: Strategic advice to build intuition
