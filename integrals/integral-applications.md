# Applications of Integration

### Key Ideas

- Integration lets us compute **net change** from a rate of change.
- Common applications include:
  - **Displacement and distance** from velocity
  - **Accumulated change** from a rate (e.g., population, volume, flow)
  - **Area** between curves
  - **Volume** of solids via slicing, disks, or shells
  - **Average value** of a function over an interval
  - **Work** and **center of mass** in physics contexts
- The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus connects **derivatives and integrals**, allowing us to evaluate accumulated quantities exactly.

## Integrals and Distance

When a function represents **velocity**, **rate of change**, or **growth**, integration lets us compute:

- **Displacement** (net change)
- **Total distance traveled**
- **Accumulated quantity**



### Displacement

If $v(t)$ is the velocity of an object over time $t \in [a, b]$, then the **displacement** is:

$$
\int_a^b v(t)\, dt
$$

This is the **signed area** between $v(t)$ and the $t$-axis.
