# Functions and Their Representations

## Key Ideas

- A function assigns **exactly one output** to each input.
- Functions can be represented **verbally, numerically, visually**, or **algebraically**.
- The **domain** is the set of allowable inputs. The **range** is the set of resulting outputs.
- The **vertical line test** determines if a graph represents a function.

## Definitions

**Function**: A rule that assigns to each element $x$ in a set $D$ exactly one element $f(x)$ in a set $R$.

- **Domain**: The set of all valid inputs $x$.
- **Range**: The set of all outputs $f(x)$ produced from inputs in the domain.

## Representations of Functions

There are four standard representations:

- **Verbal**: A description in words.  
  *Example*: “The area of a square is the square of its side length.”

- **Numerical**: A table of input-output pairs.  
  *Example*:

  | $x$ | $f(x)$ |
  |-----|--------|
  | 1   | 1      |
  | 2   | 4      |
  | 3   | 9      |

- **Visual**: A graph of points $(x, f(x))$ in the plane.

- **Algebraic**: A formula, such as $f(x) = x^2$.

## Graphs and the Vertical Line Test

A function has **only one output per input**, so its graph must pass the **vertical line test**.

> A graph represents a function if no vertical line intersects it more than once.

For example, the graph of $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ passes the test. A circle, like $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, does not—it’s not a function.

## Domain and Range

To determine the domain:

- Avoid division by zero.
- Avoid even roots of negative numbers (if working with real numbers).

**Example**:  
- $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ has domain $x \ne 0$
- $f(x) = \sqrt{x-2}$ has domain $x \geq 2$

The **range** can often be found by analyzing the output values or sketching the graph.

## Example Problems

**Example 1**:  
Is the rule $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2 - 1}$ a function? What is its domain?

**Solution**:  
It is a function because for each $x$ (excluding problem values), there is exactly one output. The domain excludes $x = \pm 1$:

$$
\text{Domain: } (-\infty, -1) \cup (-1, 1) \cup (1, \infty)
$$

---

**Example 2**:  
Does the graph of $y^2 = x$ represent a function?

**Solution**:  
No. Solve for $y$:

$$
y = \pm \sqrt{x}
$$

Two outputs for a single $x$. This violates the function definition.

## Practice Problems

1. Determine the domain and range:
   - $f(x) = \sqrt{4 - x^2}$
   - $f(x) = \ln(x - 1)$

2. Sketch the graph of $f(x) = |x|$ and verify the vertical line test.

3. Identify whether the following rule defines a function:  
   $f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x - 5}}$

4. Describe the function verbally:  
   $f(x) = 3x + 2$

## Tutor's Tip

Many students struggle because they skip mastering functions. Don’t be that student.

Functions are the **language** of calculus. You’ll differentiate and integrate them, analyze their graphs, and model real-world behavior using them.

Practice identifying:
- What is the input?
- What is the rule?
- What is the output?

Get comfortable with the **structure** of a function before moving on. This will make limits and derivatives much easier to understand.
